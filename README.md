Hi Carousell! Thanks for considering me as a candidate. 

This is actually my first time using JavaScript (and by extension React). I got a lot of help from my friends, who pointed me in the right direction about how to get started, what packages to install, and debugging many strange syntax issues.

Since I spent an evening or two learning the language, I didn't leave time and also am not sure how to write unit tests for this kind of app. I had fun though, and am happy to have been able to at least submit something. :)

I mainly followed the React quickstart resources on Facebook's github page. This simple app was compiled using create-react-app to generate the skeleton code. The pages were written by myself.

The app loads a few dummy topics when started, these can be found in the dummyTopics.js file in the public folder.

It has been deployed on heroku [here](https://not-reddit-carousell.herokuapp.com).

Hope you like it and thanks again!
