# not_reddit

This was a small project done over the weekend as part of a take-home assignment for an interview.

## the app

I mainly followed the React quickstart resources on Facebook's github page. This simple app was compiled using create-react-app to generate the skeleton code. The pages were written by myself.

The app loads a few dummy topics when started, these can be found in the dummyTopics.js file in /src.

All topics start with 1 vote, and all authors are CATs.

It has been deployed on heroku [here](https://not-reddit-carousell.herokuapp.com).

Hope you like it and thanks again!
